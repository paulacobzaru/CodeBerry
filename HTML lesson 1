   <h2>Attack<br>
    <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey 
      and can cause serious damage to victims larger than themselves.
     <br><p>Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey 
      by hitting them at high speed. They have large, 
      complex eyes and are highly colored.
     </p>
  </h2>
  <h3>Eyesight<br><p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks 
      and constantly move about independently of each other. 
      <br>
      <p>They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.
      The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive 
      both polarized light and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum.
